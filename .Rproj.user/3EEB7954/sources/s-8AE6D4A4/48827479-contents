## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
library(trawllight)
rm(list = ls())
# source("./R/vertical_profiles.R")
# source("./R/process_all.R")
# source("./R/process_all_surface.R")
# source("./R/time_adjustments.R")

# source TLUtilities functions for testing
sapply(paste("./R/", dir("./R/"), sep = ""), source)

#require(dplyr)

# Import csv file containing filepaths for light data DIRECTORIES. Each target directories should contain corr_Mk9Hauls.csv, deck1**.csv, and CastTimes.csv for a vessel/cruise combination. This list needs to be created by the user.
light.dir <- read.csv("D:/Projects/OneDrive/Thesis/Chapter 1 - Visual Foraging Condition in the Eastern Bering Sea/data/fileinv_lightdata_directory.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, header = F)


# Only use EBS shelf directories.
light.dir <- light.dir[which(grepl("ebs", light.dir[,1])),1]

# Let's examine what this does
print(head(light.dir))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
